# fair share greedy Algo 

### the program will get an exel table with col - k, and row - m 
### and give each k the m that he most wanted while making sure that m not been taken already by other k 
#### its like the knapsack problem with some changes.
#### I used greedy algo in order to get the result O(n) - as n represent the num of cell in the given xl 
#### the program using openpyxl, and also export the answer in a new exel file named "ex1.xlsx"

### the program need to get XL in this form:

# fair share Boston-Mechanism Algo
### program that can assing gropes of people to location 
### the program will get an exel table with col - m, and row - k (you can see how the exel spused to look like in p_mek.xlsx) 
### k-beds - repressnt how much people can get into this place
### each k places can only get one group
### m-head - repressnt how many people there is in each group

## out put with both the prefernce and the assingment for each group m
